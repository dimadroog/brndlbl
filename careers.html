                                                    <li>You’re comfortable with complexity. Delivering a simple experience to our users sometimes means managing large and intricate systems behind the scenes.</li>

You’ll review code, infrastructure, and processes to spot weaknesses, and you’ll implement robust and pragmatic solutions to those that you find.</li>
                                                    <li>You’ll be an owner. We believe in hiring smart people and giving them as much responsibility as they can handle.
