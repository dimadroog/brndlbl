                            Coinheart's intellectual property policy is to: (i) remove or disable access to material
                            that Coinheart believes in good faith, upon notice from an intellectual property owner or
                            his or her agent, is infringing the intellectual property of a third party by being made
                            available through the Site; (ii) remove any User Content Submitted by Users who are
                            determined to be “repeat infringers”; and (iii) promptly terminate the Accounts of repeat
                            infringers. Coinheart currently considers a “repeat infringer” to be any User that has
                            Submitted User Content and for whom Coinheart has received more than two takedown notices
                            compliant with the provisions of 17 U.S.C. § 512 with respect to such User Content.
                            Coinheart has discretion, however, to terminate the Account of any User after receipt of a
                            single Notification of Claimed Infringement (as defined in Section 5.a) or upon Coinheart's
                            own determination.

                            <u>General.</u>
                            In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Coinheart in the most expedient and
                            cost-effective manner, you and Coinheart agree that any dispute arising out of or in any
                            way related to this Agreement or your use of the Site or Services will be resolved by
                            binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses
                            a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than
                            in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the
                            same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes
                            includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to this Agreement or your use of
                            the Site or Services, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation
                            or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after any
                            subsequent updates to or after the termination of this Agreement. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE
                            THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND Coinheart ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A
                            TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE SUBJECT
                            TO AND GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT.

                            Notwithstanding Section 9.a above, nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to waive,
                            preclude or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an individual action
                            in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal,
                            state or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in aid of
                            arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law
                            to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

                            Any arbitration between you and Coinheart will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act
                            and be finally settled in binding arbitration, on an individual basis, in accordance with
                            the JAMS rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes (accessible at
                            https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/) and you and Coinheart hereby
                            expressly waive trial by jury and right to participate in a class action lawsuit or
                            class-wide arbitration. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute
                            relating to the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of this binding
                            arbitration agreement and the Agreement.

                            <u>Notice; Process.</u>
                            A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to
                            the other party by U.S. Mail (“Notice”). Coinheart's address for Notice is: 15 Passingham House Ferraro Close, Heston, Hounslow, Middlesex, United Kingdom, TW5 0BF
                             or by email at <a href="mailto:support@Coinheart.net">support@Coinheart.net</a>
                             Attn: Legal
                            Department. The Notice must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute;
                            and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties agree to make good
                            faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement
                            to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, then you or Coinheart may commence an
                            arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by
                            you or Coinheart must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a
                            final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration
                            in your favor with a monetary award that exceeds the last written settlement amount
                            offered by Coinheart prior to selection of an arbitrator, then Coinheart will pay you the
                            highest of the following: (1) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (2) the last
                            written settlement amount offered by Coinheart in settlement of the dispute prior to the
                            arbitrator's award; or (3) $15,000.

                            <u>Fees.</u>
                            If you commence arbitration in accordance with this Agreement, then Coinheart will
                            reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than
                            $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by
                            the JAMS Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in
                            New York, New York, but if the claim is for $15,000 or less, then you may choose whether
                            the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the
                            arbitrator; or (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing. If the arbitrator
                            finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is
                            frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in
                            Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by
                            the JAMS Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Coinheart for all monies previously
                            disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the JAMS Rules. Regardless
                            of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned
                            written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the
                            decision and award, if any, are based. Each party agrees that such written decision, and
                            information exchanged during arbitration, will be kept confidential except to the extent
                            necessary to enforce or permit limited judicial review of the award. The arbitrator may
                            make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses
                            at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days
                            of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
                            the contrary, and for the avoidance of doubt, the arbitrator can award injunctive relief
                            as a remedy in any arbitration required under these dispute resolution provisions.

                            respect to its conflict of laws provisions. You agree that no joint venture, partnership,

                            provision of this Agreement will not be construed as a waiver of that provision or any other
                            provision in this Agreement. No waiver will be effective against Coinheart unless made in
                            writing, and no such waiver will be construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent
                            instance. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Coinheart with
                            respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous
                            agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter
                            hereof. The Section headings are provided merely for convenience and will not be given any

                            prior express written consent of Coinheart. “Assignment” as used in the prior sentence
                            includes any changes of control or sale of stock or assets of any Organization. Coinheart may

                                with such third party, you must resolve the dispute directly with that third party. If you

                                Each executed transaction is subject to a fee (a "Transaction Fee"). The applicable
                                Transaction Fee is displayed to you on the Coinheart Markets Site prior to your completion of
                                an order instruction. Coinheart Markets may not process an order if the Transaction Fee and
                                any other associated fees as may apply exceed the value of your transaction. Coinheart
                                Markets may waive some portion of the Transaction Fee depending on the payment method you
                                select. The availability of each payment method depends on a number of factors, including
                                but not limited to your location, the identification information you have provided to us,
                                and limitations imposed by third party payment processors. Taxes may apply, and additional
                                fees may be assessed by our Custodian Partner and by recipients’ banks.

                                If you have a dispute with Coinheart Markets, we will attempt to resolve any such disputes
                                through our support team.

                                If we cannot resolve the dispute through our support team, you and we agree that any
                                dispute arising under this Agreement shall be finally settled in binding arbitration, on
                                an individual basis, in accordance with the JAMS rules for arbitration of
                                consumer-related disputes (accessible at

                                </strong>
                                The arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator in the Southern District
                                of New York. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction
                                could award, including attorneys' fees when authorized by law, and the arbitral decision
                                may be enforced in any court. At your request, hearings may be conducted in person or by
                                telephone and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs,
                                without oral hearings. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this
                                agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys' fees.
                                <p>
                                If the arbitrator(s) or arbitration administrator would impose filing fees or other
                                administrative costs on you, we will reimburse you, upon request, to the extent such
                                fees or costs would exceed those that you would otherwise have to pay if you were
                                proceeding in a court. We will pay additional fees or costs if required to do so by the
                                arbitration administrator's rules or applicable law. Apart from the foregoing, each
                                Party will be responsible for any other fees or costs, such as attorney fees that the
                                Party may incur. If a court decides that any provision of this section is invalid or
                                unenforceable, that provision shall be severed and the other parts of this section shall
                                still apply. In any case, the remainder of this User Agreement will continue to apply.

                                will settle trades in a number of Digital Currencies and Fiat Currency Trading Pairs. Each
                                User's Account will list which Order Books are available to the User. The following set of
                                Rules governs Orders placed via the open Order Books.

                                To place an Order on an Order Book, a User must have an available balance of the
                                relevant trading pair in their Account which is sufficient to cover the total value of
                                the Order plus any applicable fees.

                                “slippage.”

                                A Stop Order can be placed as either a Stop Market Order, which posts a Market Order
                                when the Stop Price is triggered, or a Stop Limit Order, which posts a Limit Order when
                                the Stop Price is triggered.

                                ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that the customer initiates the

                                The value of virtual currency may be derived from the continued willingness of market
                                participants to exchange fiat currency for virtual currency, which may result in the
                                potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular virtual currency should

                                The volatility and unpredictability of the price of virtual currency relative to fiat

                                Coinheart Markets LTD ("CLM" or the "Firm") has developed a Business Continuity and Disaster
                                Recovery Plan ("BCDRP") on how CLM will respond to events that significantly disrupt its
                                business. Since the timing and impact of disasters and disruptions is unpredictable, CLM
                                will have to be flexible in responding to actual events as they occur. With that in mind,
                                CLM is providing you with this information on BCDRP.

                                CLM plans to quickly recover and resume business operations after an SBD and respond by
                                safeguarding its employees and property, making a financial and operational assessment,
                                protecting the Firm's books and records and allowing its customers to transact business. In
                                short, the Firm's BCDRP is designed to permit CLM to resume operations as quickly as
                                possible, given the scope and severity of the SBD.

                                Varying Disruptions
                                </strong>
                                SBD can vary in scope, impacting only CLM, a single building of the Firm, the region, city
                                or business district in which the Firm is located. Within each of these areas, the severity
                                of the disruption can also vary from minimal to severe. In the event of a disruption
                                impacting only the Firm or the building in which its located, CLM will transfer its
                                operations to a local site as needed, with the expectation to recover and resume business
                                within 2 business days. In the event a disruption is wider in scope, affecting either the
                                region, city or business district in which the Firm is located, CLM will transfer its
                                operations to a site outside of the affected area and recover and resume business within 3
                                business days. In the event of a disruption to the Firm's data center, CLM will take steps
                                to promptly transition to a different data center and seek to recover and resume business
                                within one business day. In either situation, CLM plans to continue in business and keep you
                                informed through the Firm's public website (<a href="index.html">https://coinheart.net/</a>
                                ) and by email. If the SBD is so
                                severe that it prevents CLM from continuing its business, CLM will assure our customer's
                                prompt access to their funds and securities.
